# confluent_schema Data Source

[![Open Preview](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lifecycle%20Stage-Open%20Preview-%2300afba)](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/api.html#section/Versioning/API-Lifecycle-Policy)

-> **Note:** `confluent_schema` data source is available in **Open Preview** for early adopters. Open Preview features are introduced to gather customer feedback. This feature should be used only for evaluation and non-production testing purposes or to provide feedback to Confluent, particularly as it becomes more widely available in follow-on editions.  
**Open Preview** features are intended for evaluation use in development and testing environments only, and not for production use. The warranty, SLA, and Support Services provisions of your agreement with Confluent do not apply to Open Preview features. Open Preview features are considered to be a Proof of Concept as defined in the Confluent Cloud Terms of Service. Confluent may discontinue providing preview releases of the Open Preview features at any time in Confluentâ€™s sole discretion.

`confluent_schema` describes a Schema data source.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "confluent_schema" "purchase-v1" {
  schema_registry_cluster {
    id = confluent_schema_registry_cluster.essentials.id
  }
  rest_endpoint = confluent_schema_registry_cluster.essentials.rest_endpoint
  subject_name = "proto-purchase-value"
  schema_identifier = 10001
  credentials {
    key    = "<Schema Registry API Key for confluent_schema_registry_cluster.essentials>"
    secret = "<Schema Registry API Secret for confluent_schema_registry_cluster.essentials>"
  }
}

output "schema" {
  value = data.confluent_schema.purchase-v1.schema
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

- `schema_registry_cluster` - (Required Configuration Block) supports the following:
  - `id` - (Required String) The ID of the Schema Registry cluster, for example, `lsrc-abc123`.
- `rest_endpoint` - (Optional String) The REST endpoint of the Schema Registry cluster, for example, `https://psrc-00000.us-central1.gcp.confluent.cloud:443`).
- `credentials` (Optional Configuration Block) supports the following:
  - `key` - (Required String) The Schema Registry API Key.
  - `secret` - (Required String, Sensitive) The Schema Registry API Secret.
- `subject_name` - (Required String) The name of the subject (in other words, the namespace), representing the subject under which the schema will be registered, for example, `test-subject`. Schemas evolve safely, following a compatibility mode defined, under a subject name.
- `schema_identifier` - (Required Integer) The globally unique ID of the Schema, for example, `100003`. If the same schema is registered under a different subject, the same identifier will be returned. However, the `version` of the schema may be different under different subjects.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the preceding arguments, the following attributes are exported:

- `id` - (Required String) The ID of the Schema, in the format `<Schema Registry cluster ID>/<Subject name>/<Schema identifier>`, for example, `lsrc-abc123/test-subject/100003`.
- `format` - (Required String) The format of the schema. Accepted values are: `AVRO`, `PROTOBUF`, and `JSON`.
- `schema` - (Required String) The schema string, for example, `file("./schema_version_1.avsc")`.
- `schema_reference` - (Optional List) The list of referenced schemas (see [Schema References](https://docs.confluent.io/platform/current/schema-registry/serdes-develop/index.html#schema-references) for more details):
  - `name` - (Required String) The name of the subject, representing the subject under which the referenced schema is registered.
  - `subject_name` - (Required String) The name for the reference. (For Avro Schema, the reference name is the fully qualified schema name, for JSON Schema it is a URL, and for Protobuf Schema, it is the name of another Protobuf file.)
  - `version` - (Required Integer) The version, representing the exact version of the schema under the registered subject.
- `version` - (Required Integer) The version of the Schema, for example, `4`.
