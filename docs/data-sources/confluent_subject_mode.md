# confluent_subject_mode Data Source

[![Open Preview](https://img.shields.io/badge/Lifecycle%20Stage-Open%20Preview-%2300afba)](https://docs.confluent.io/cloud/current/api.html#section/Versioning/API-Lifecycle-Policy)

-> **Note:** `confluent_subject_mode` data source is available in **Open Preview** for early adopters. Open Preview features are introduced to gather customer feedback. This feature should be used only for evaluation and non-production testing purposes or to provide feedback to Confluent, particularly as it becomes more widely available in follow-on editions.  
**Open Preview** features are intended for evaluation use in development and testing environments only, and not for production use. The warranty, SLA, and Support Services provisions of your agreement with Confluent do not apply to Open Preview features. Open Preview features are considered to be a Proof of Concept as defined in the Confluent Cloud Terms of Service. Confluent may discontinue providing preview releases of the Open Preview features at any time in Confluentâ€™s sole discretion.

`confluent_subject_mode` describes a Subject Mode data source.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "confluent_subject_mode" "purchase-v1" {
  schema_registry_cluster {
    id = confluent_schema_registry_cluster.essentials.id
  }
  rest_endpoint = confluent_schema_registry_cluster.essentials.rest_endpoint
  subject_name = "proto-purchase-value"
  credentials {
    key    = "<Schema Registry API Key for confluent_schema_registry_cluster.essentials>"
    secret = "<Schema Registry API Secret for confluent_schema_registry_cluster.essentials>"
  }
}

output "mode" {
  value = data.confluent_subject_mode.purchase-v1.mode
}
```

## Argument Reference

The following arguments are supported:

- `schema_registry_cluster` - (Required Configuration Block) supports the following:
  - `id` - (Required String) The ID of the Schema Registry cluster, for example, `lsrc-abc123`.
- `rest_endpoint` - (Optional String) The REST endpoint of the Schema Registry cluster, for example, `https://psrc-00000.us-central1.gcp.confluent.cloud:443`).
- `credentials` (Optional Configuration Block) supports the following:
  - `key` - (Required String) The Schema Registry API Key.
  - `secret` - (Required String, Sensitive) The Schema Registry API Secret.
- `subject_name` - (Required String) The name of the subject (in other words, the namespace), representing the subject under which the schema will be registered, for example, `test-subject`.

-> **Note:** Omit the `rest_endpoint` attribute and the `credentials`, `schema_registry_cluster` blocks if the `schema_registry_id`, `schema_registry_rest_endpoint`, `schema_registry_api_key`, and `schema_registry_api_secret` attributes are all set in a `provider` block (see [option #2](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/confluentinc/confluent/latest/docs#example-usage)).

-> **Note:** A Schema Registry API key consists of a key and a secret. Schema Registry API keys are required to interact with Schema Registry clusters in Confluent Cloud. Each Schema Registry API key is valid for one specific Schema Registry cluster.

## Attributes Reference

In addition to the preceding arguments, the following attributes are exported:

- `id` - (Required String) The ID of the Schema, in the format `<Schema Registry cluster ID>/<Subject name>/<Schema identifier>`, for example, `lsrc-abc123/test-subject/100003`.
- `mode` - (Required String) The mode of the specified subject. Accepted values are: `READWRITE`, `READONLY`, `READONLY_OVERRIDE`, and `IMPORT`.
